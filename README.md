# CursorLocker
Locks your cursor to your main monitor as long as your focused application matches one of the specified names.

This Code is really crude and doesn't use any form of databindings or mvvm despite being wpf.<br>
It is just a quickly thrown-together tool to solve a problem that had an easy fix.

### Theoretical Todos:  
- Autorun on user login option
- portable mode
- options to toggle minimize-to-tray and close-to-try
- program icons (e.g. for the tray)

I probably will not work on this myself any time soon.<br>
Suggestions and improvements are welcome. preferably in the form of pull requests :)
